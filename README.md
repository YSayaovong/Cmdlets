# Cmdlets

For this Assignment you are going to find and run 30 unique Cmdlets. It is recommended that you watch the lecture on the Help System to see how to call a list of Native Cmdlets in your Windows Powershell runtime environment.

In your Windows VM:

Start Powershell and run the cmdlet [Start-transcript]
Run your 30 different Cmdlets one after another
Run the cmdlet [Stop-transcript]
Go to file location where the .txt is stored
Rename the file to "FirstName-LastName-Assignment6b.txt"
Upload file to this Assignment section before the Deadline
I have linked to Microsoft documentation on how Start-Transcript and Stop-Transcript work below:

Start-Transcript
Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/start-transcript?view=powershell-7Links to an external site.

Stop-Transcript
Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/stop-transcript?view=powershell-7Links to an external site.

Note: Unless you specify where the file is stored, [Start-Transcript] stores the transcripts in the $Home\My Documents directory as \PowerShell_transcript.<time-stamp>.txt files.
